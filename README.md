# Image Kernel Playground

This project is a Jupyter Notebook–based sandbox for experimenting with a wide range of convolution kernels.  
The notebook applies each kernel to sample images so you can visually compare how different filters affect edges, textures, and overall appearance.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Virtual environment (recommended)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Setup

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
